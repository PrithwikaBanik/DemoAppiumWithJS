Demo Project AppiumWithJS
This project is a sample exercise that demonstrates how to execute Cucumber UI tests using JavaScript in combination with Appium. The setup allows you to write and run automated UI tests for mobile applications, leveraging Cucumber's BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach for creating human-readable test cases. The integration with Appium enables cross-platform testing on Android and iOS devices, while JavaScript provides the scripting language for implementing the test logic.
